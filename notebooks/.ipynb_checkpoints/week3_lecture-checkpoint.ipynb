    "# Week 3 - Data handling: pandas and numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python modules `pandas` and `numpy` are very useful tools to handle datasets and apply basic operations on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the things we have learnt in weeks 1 and 2 using native Python (e.g. accessing, working with and writing data files) can often be easily achieved using `pandas` instead. This module offers data structures and operations for manipulating different types of datasets - see [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules `pandas` and `numpy` do not come as part of the default Anaconda installation. In order to install them in your system, open your Windows command line and run the following command: `conda install pandas`. The module `numpy` should install automatically with the `pandas` installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Once they are installed, we can import them using the aliases `pd` and `np` as follows:"

    "Generally, columns in a `DataFrame` are known as the observed variables, and the rows are the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas `DataFrame` object borrows many features from R's `data.frame`. Both are 2-dimensional tables whose columns can contain different data types (e.g. boolean, integer, float, categorical/factor). Both the rows and columns are indexed, and can be referred to by number or name.\n",
