    "\n",
    "### Course structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a data science course in *Python3* (hereafter referred to as just *Python*) designed for participants with basic Python experience. The course will be run over **6 weeks** with the following structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monday lectures** will start with information about Python syntax, the Jupyter notebook interface, and move through concepts such as how to write functions and handle data, using the *pandas* and *numpy* packages, how to calculate summary information from a data frame, and approaches to do plotting. The lecture will conclude with the unveiling of an **assignment**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Participants will be invited to review the materials presented on the lecture and complete the assignment during the rest of the week (Tuesday-Thursday). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The trainers will provide a walk-through the assigment on **Friday recap** sessions. Questions from the participants are welcomed by e-mail or chat during the week or directly during the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The course will cover concepts and strategies for working with data more effectively in Python with the aim of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing **reusable** code, using functions and libraries\n",
    "- Acquiring a working knowledge of **key concepts** which are prerequisites for advanced programming like writing classes to build objects\n",
    "- Using Python **libraries** to explore data in files\n",
    "- Creating **functions** and **modules** to write reusable code\n",
    "- Manipulating data using **pandas** and **numpy**\n",
    "- Visualising data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course materials\n",
    "\n",
    "The course materials (lectures, assignments and solutions) are accessible on GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/semacu/data-science-python\n",
    "\n",
    "We’d like you to follow along with the example code as we go through the materials together, and attempt the assignment to practice what you’ve learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is open to everyone with some basic knowledge of Python. We are so excited that you want to learn Python :) ! We will start with a brief recap on Python basic concepts and we will build up from there. You will set the pace and the amount of material that we will cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions are welcome at any point by e-mail or *via* the chat functionality in Microsoft Teams!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a general purpose programming language that is useful for writing scripts to work effectively and reproducibly with data. It was initially created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python is widely used in data science, bioinformatics and scientific computing, as well as in academia and industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is available in all popular operating systems Mac, Windows and Linux. The default Python installation comes with \"batteries included\" and the standard library (some of which we will see in this course) provides built-in support for lots of common tasks e.g. numerical & mathematical functions, interacting with files and the operating system ... There is also a wide range of external libraries for areas not covered in the standard library, such as Pandas (the Python ANalysis DAta Library), Matplotlib (the Python plotting library) and the BioPython Library which provides tools for bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter** is a nonprofit organization created to \"develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages\". Jupyter supports execution environments in several dozen programming languages. Jupyter has developed and supported the interactive computing products e.g. Jupyter Notebook, which we will be using during this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, interactive data visualizations and explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to run Python?** Python is an interpreted language, this means that your computer does not run Python code natively, but instead we run our code using the Python interpreter. There are three ways in which you can run Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directly typing commands into the interpreter: Good for experimenting with the language, and for some interactive work\n",
    "- Using a Jupyter Notebook: Great for experimenting with the language, and for sharing and learning\n",
    "- Typing code into a file and then telling the interpreter to run the code from this file: Good for larger programs, and when you want to run the same code repeatedly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this course you will need to ensure that your computer is set up with the required software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you may find it useful (but not essential) to have a dual screen setup or two devices, e.g. laptop and tablet/phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any difficulty installing any of this software then please contact one of the trainers for help.\n",
